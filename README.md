### Running react native on Android on Win7 x64

Go to [react-native getting started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) and follow installation steps. Install Android SDK or Android Studio

Add *ANDROID_HOME*
```
c:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\tools
```
Note that extactly *..\sdk\tools* and not just *..\sdk*


Install Java [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (not JRE)

Add *JAVA_HOME* to environment variables. Should be like this
```
c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111\
```
To check - run in console:
```
java
```
You should not see "java not found", and java's help instead
